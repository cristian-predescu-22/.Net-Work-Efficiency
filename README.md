# .Net-Work-Efficiency-Script
This small script was made because my workplace required me to enter data from client images and make sure it followed the PASCAL format. They had an handwriting recognition software but the softwere would write it as it sees it (Which was not PASCAL) so i created this to this script that when you enter data it will output the PASCAL version of it.

I had to write it in C# because the PC's at work didn't really let you run anything, but for some reason .Net3.5 was installed, so it executed these programs with no issue.
