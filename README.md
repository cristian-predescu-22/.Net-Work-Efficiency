# .Net-Work-Efficiency
This small script was made because my work place required to enter data from client image and make sure it follows PASCAL format. They had an handwriting recognition software but the softwere would write it as it sees it (Which was not PASCAL) so i created this to this script that when you enter data it will output the PASCAL version of it.
